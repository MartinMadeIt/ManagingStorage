# Managing App üì¶

### Created it because :
Managing App arrised from a Redux training. Now Redux is used here for:
* Managing Company finance - you can place order with 100 PLN bank account but you will not pay for this order if it is above 100 PLN
* Managing orders - thanks to Redux you can freely add/delete orders before adding it to server.


### What's inside ?
* First view - view that you see on screenshot above. There is your company name that you can freely change by clicking Settings in top-left corner.
* Bottom % - default 100% is 10k PLN. This % is ammount of money that was deposited by 'Deposit' button
* Click an image to go into App
<br>
* Main site - that's the place where you can manage your account. You can also see some options in right. Jsut ecplore it.
<br>

### Main purpose - schema:
* Place and order with correct data. You can ad one or more positions to order
* Deposit some money to your account
* Go to orders and match orders that you want to pay. Remember that summary price of all matched orders has to be lower than your bank account.
* If you payed for that - orders will dissapear from 'unpayed list' and this summary price will be substract from account
* Now you can go to Invoices and see orders that was payed by transaction number. You can filter by date or enable 'Show all'
* When you will click filename you will see what orders you have paid for in this transaction.

# PROJECT IS NOT FINISHED ! What will change ?
1.  üì¶ Magazine - one of the most important pilars of this App. It will storage all of yours items that you payed for (from orders). For now - app uses json-server that was good for begining. But as the App grew - I decided that it will be more clear and comfortable to use SQL database. So for now - I'm transferring data from json-server to postgreSQL. After that I will code some logic that will make it easier for you to use Magazine.
2. üñäÔ∏è Editability - For now some of operations have disabled options.
3. üëåüèª Design - some major differences will be released when all of logic things will be done.
4. üìö Libraries - I will add some libraries to project like tanstack and lazy loading.
5. ‚ùì EXTRAS - Stay tuned !
